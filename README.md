#### Contributor: https://github.com/JoshLobo-21

To measure the revolutions per minute of a rotating body, i.e. a wheel and to understand the working and modelling of an instrumentation system.

### Methodology & Observation:
The objectives are to measure the revolutions per minute of a rotating body (wheel) and gain insights into the operation and modelling of an instrumentation system. Additionally, the measured value will be wirelessly transmitted to a data presentation element.

### Result: 
Accurate speed measurement is vital in various industries like paper manufacturing, automobiles, aviation, robots, etc., due to its significance as a crucial parameter. Thus, the objectives were met.
